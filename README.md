How to get more free spins in Coin Master?
Wait, what's that? Do you want more Coin Master free rewards? I hear you, and I am here to help you out! Below you can find a bunch of other ways to collect even more free spins in Coin Master. Check them out!
Follow the game's social media
Did you know that the game has additional rewards and giveaways on its official Twitter page? Make sure you follow it if you're trying to stay up to date with all the latest links.
Alternatively, you can always check out the game's official Facebook page.

Invite friends to play Coin Master
If that's not enough, you can always rely on your friends (quite literally). For each new friend that you invite to play Coin Master, you'll receive 40 free spins. After you've invited a bunch of friends, you can ask for their help too.
Add in-game friends and request free spins
After expanding your friend list quite a bit (just a fair warning, it might take a while to max it out), you can start requesting daily spins from each of your friends. This will amount to a number of extra free spins, and you can do it every single day. The maximum number of free spins you can claim each day from friends is 100.
Watch ads that offer free spins
Watching ads can be a little time-consuming and can get rather annoying, but when the reward is free spins, you might want to reconsider. Watching a short 30-second ad for some free spins is always good, so make sure you do that every time you get the chance.
Save up your Spins and use them when you have more than 30
In Coin Master, you will gain Spins passively, over time (aside from the free ones you'll find above). A Free Spin refills every 12 minutes, but you shouldn't spend them as soon as they fill up. Instead, try to save them as long as possible because you can then take advantage of the 2x and 3x multiplier by spending 2 or 3 rolls instead of 1. The best would be to get multiples of 3, because that would be, in my experience, the most advantageous.
So, if you want to get the best possible reward, log into the game every 6-7 hours, and start spinning. You can find a daily routine that lets you get the daily free and your normal AFK-generated ones and go for a big slot machine bonus.

Upgrade your Village
Never underestimate the power of upgrading your Village. Yes, it is time-consuming and expensive, but you'll always get back a guaranteed bunch of spins.
Spin more?
Each time you spin, there is a chance for you to win extra spins - that's right, you can get more spins by simply spinning more and more!
Last but not least, don't miss any in-game events!
There are quite a few in-game events, and you should try to complete as many tasks from each event as you can. They will give you lots of free spins as rewards, and it would be a pity missing out on those free extra goodies.

In the meantime, if you want to learn more about the game, I've prepared a few more Coin Master tips and tricks to help you build every village and get richer in the game! Check them out below!

Don't hoard your Gold!
I know you might be tempted to hoard all of that Gold and try to get super-rich and possibly famous, but for all the wrong reasons - you might get raided and lose it all! You probably know that in Coin Master, other players can attack your village and if you have a lot of Gold stored up, it's definitely going to put a target on your back.
Try to spend all the Gold (or as much as possible) as soon as you get it because even if you get raided, you won't lose as much. The three trees combo will give you protection against those pesky looters, so they won't be able to steal as much Gold.
